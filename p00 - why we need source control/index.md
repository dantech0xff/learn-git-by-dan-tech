# Why we need source control?

## Introduction

- Source control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- It allows you to
  - revert files back to a previous state,
  - revert the entire project back to a previous state,
  - compare changes over time,
  - see who last modified something that might be causing a problem,
  - who introduced an issue and when, and more.
- It's a critical tool for developers to manage their codebase and collaborate with others.

Shoutout to Linus Torvalds for creating Git, a distributed version control system that is widely used by developers around the world!
